# Ising-simulation
python codes for simulations of various properties of ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic lattices using classical Ising model

The file ising_temp.py is the python code for caluclating the graphs of magnetization vs temp and suscpetibility vs temp for the system parameters that can be changed.
The ppt. file contains the previous results before the debugging of the code.
